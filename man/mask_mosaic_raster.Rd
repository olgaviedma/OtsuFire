\title{Mosaic Rasters with Burnable Mask and Resample to 90m}
\usage{
mask_mosaic_raster(
  folder_path,
  mask_shapefile,
  gdalwarp_path,
  crs_target = 3035,
  tile_buffer = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder_path}{Path to the folder containing input rasters to process.}

\item{mask_shapefile}{Path to the shapefile mask (burnable area).}

\item{gdalwarp_path}{Path to the GDAL `gdalwarp` executable (for reprojection/resampling).}

\item{crs_target}{EPSG code for reprojection (default is 3035; ETRS89 LAEA).}

\item{tile_buffer}{Buffer in meters applied if mask and raster do not initially overlap.}
}
\value{
The path to the final resampled raster.
}
\description{
This fucntion applies a shapefile mask to all raster files (tiles) in a single folder, mosaics them by maximum value,
and resamples the final mosaic to 90m resolution using GDAL. Output filenames preserve the core identifier
from the original raster name, right before the year digits. Intermediate masked rasters are deleted after use.
